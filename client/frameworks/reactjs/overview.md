# ReactJS Architecture Overview

This section documents React-specific implementation details for the client architecture.

ReactJS concerns include:

- Component boundaries in TSX (business vs presentation)
- Form state patterns (`react-hook-form` + StandardForm)
- UI primitives and composition (`shadcn/ui`, Radix/Base UI)
- Client coordination state patterns (Zustand)

See `client/core/` for the framework-agnostic architecture and rules.
